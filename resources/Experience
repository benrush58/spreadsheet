    Overall, we thought this assignment was more interesting and less stressful because we were
modifying code, not starting from scratch. We also enjoyed seeing other peoples' approaches to the
same assignment. This assignment mimics coops/jobs, so it felt beneficial to get practice in a
different skill set that we will need.
    I would have liked to do something like this more often or earlier in the class, though I
understand why that was not an option. Maybe doing this after PyramidSolitaire could have been
helpful, as I feel like I understand the MVC architecture so much better after completing this
assignment, and that could have helped a lot more in the design of BeyondG00d.
    The one thing that was tricky was emailing back and forth with both our customers and our
providers. In the future, it might be nice to have students meet up to ensure that customers
can compile the providers code, and that the providers can make fixes and send them back to the
customers early on.
